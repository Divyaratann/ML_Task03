🤖 Customer Support Chatbot
Machine Learning Task 3 — Future Interns Program
💬 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Customer Support Chatbot, designed to simulate real-world virtual assistants used by platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and Zomato.

The chatbot can greet users, respond to frequently asked questions, and provide fallback messages for unrecognized queries. It’s built using Dialogflow, a no-code AI tool for developing intelligent conversational agents.

🚀 Features

🗣️ Interactive Conversations — Handles greetings, queries, and support questions.

🔍 FAQ Handling — Answers common customer queries (e.g., “Where is my order?”).

🤝 Fallback Responses — Gracefully manages unrecognized input.

🌐 Optional Integrations — Can connect to websites, Telegram, or Streamlit apps.

🕒 24/7 Availability — Offers automated responses any time of day.
